yesterday I made alot of progress.

I can now display the world and also pathfinding kinda works. but it does take a suboptimal path. this i have to debug in the days to came.

Also I should start adding some test, as i had some bugs yesterday which would be easily caught by test.

but hey one milestone is done! the creep finds a path and avoids obstacles.
