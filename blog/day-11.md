currently the problem is that the path finding algorithm kinda works but is not fun to watch.
https://github.com/beefsack/go-astar/tree/master <-- this is a working implementation. I could use it as "insparation"


the other thing is that the memory of the creep could be a queue.
next the harvesting functionallity can be added.

also there are test needed.

Unfortunately there will be not a lot of coding today as work and free time will take a big chunk of time.
