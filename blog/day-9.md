I stopped debugging the pathfinding and started to refactor the code.
currently the code base got hacked in and by that i got a first mvp.
This is fine but there are some weird behaviors and also some workarounds build in that need to be cleaned up before i can proceed further.

just one idea for the memory of a creep:
maybe it is possible to make the memory a list of function.
