# MVP
Currently the app can plot a grid with random obstacles into the console.
The creep is able to find the fastest way by using the a* algorithm.

# Disclaimer

as I am currently working alone on this project and it is not really a big code base, i am committing directly onto main. so main is not expected to run at all times and can contain WIP code.
